#### ***Chapter 1 - Playful Beginnings***

To start the story we have to fall back multiple years. I believe this story starts sometime near mid 2018. Me and my friends are having a lot of fun playing a popular game called *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* a.k.a *PUBG*. 

PUBG is a battle royale game. 100 people parachute from a plane into the map, scavenge for gear like weapons and armor, and fight to survive as the map shrinks in size, the last team alive wins. Most of the time you are on foot, however, the game includes vehicles that you can drive, including at the time a UAZ jeep, a Dacia 1300, a Buggy, and most important to this story a Motorcycle and a Trike.

By this time, we had been playing the game for a while, as the game released at the end of 2017 and we were pretty to quick to hop onto the wagon. So at this point, I found we were playing 1 of 2 types of games at any given time. We were either trying really hard to win, or trying reaaaally hard to have fun. Me and my friend Dylan leaning more towards the latter. 

So the thing with *PUBG* is that looking back, the game itself wasn't exactly that great.. a lot of bugs, glitches and hackers. The most bugged part of the game being the vehicles. You would lose control of the vehicle with any small piece of uneven terrain, and hitting anything at speed would result in either an explosion or you being forcefully ejected out of the moving vehicle, usually resulting in death.

In most cases, bugs end up being a really bad thing and make the game less fun... but when it came to the vehicles in PUBG, they were so bugged and glitched, that it resulted in extremely funny situations that immediately might not be your desired outcome, as you had just spent the whole game searching for scraps of gear, but it overall ended up being so hilarious it was worth it. 

Me and Dylan picking up on this fact after a while came to the conclusion that the most fun vehicle is the Motorcycle. Why was it the most fun? It being the fastest and smallest vehicle, you were able to do tricks like flips with it! 

So me and Dylan proceeded to hunt for motorcycles... go to the biggest hill on the map... drive full speed up it while screaming *The Smashing Pumpkins* lyric from the song *Bullet with Butterfly Wings* "THE WORLD IS A VAMPIIIRE" while flipping in the air and proceeding to make air guitar noises while our other two teammates are actually trying to win the game. 

Looking something like this(but sometimes with more smoke coming out of the bike):

This would commonly end in the explosions or ejection as previously mentioned. One of my fondest memories of playing games ever is this few weeks or months of performing this and similar stunts.

This was my first time having fun with motorcycles. 

#### ***Chapter 2 - PUBG's Decline***

We would continue to play the game, slowly playing less and less in favor of other games, still using motorcycles, but not always as stunt men.

One night me and my friends Kevin and Troy are playing, and we all find motorcycles . In discord we begin talking about how fun motorcycles are in the game, and how Troy and Kevin both want to ride together in real life(Troy having his dad's bike, Kevin not yet having one). Me thinking about it at the time thought, ya motorcycles are totally bad-ass and all experiences I have with them are either funny or cool at this point, so I also agree that we should all get bikes one day and ride together. On December 30, 2018, I send the following picture in Snapchat with the caption "*Reenactment of Me, Kevin and Troy 2k19*":

#### ***Chapter 3 -  Excitement!***

One of the things I liked and still like to do is watch Youtube videos. Over the span of a couple months, while falling into whatever Youtube holes I stumbled to in 2018, I was recommended videos like "*Bikers are awesome compilation #32*" or "*Bikers vs Cops episode #23243*" which I watched and enjoyed. Once Youtube recognized I was watching these motorcycle compilations, eventually it started to recommended moto-vlog channels like [WALTERRIFIC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl41VS1Nqxd3HnR-JyPA-tQ) which I also enjoyed. Then I found the [FortNine channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNSMdQtn1SuFzCZjfK2C7dQ) through Reddit, which has amazing videos about motorcycles.

In my mind, this "plan" I had with my friends turned from us shooting the shit to something I could actually do.. and I was then excited and decided that I was *actually* going to get a bike with big dreams of me hopping on the bike and taking off into the sunset(or like... the grocery store). I started watching how-to guides, bought my provinces study guide for the test and started studying. Where I live you take a written test, followed by a mandatory course, followed by a driving test to get your learners. Once you have your learners, you then need to take one more driving test a year later to get the full license. I passed the written, then signed up for the course and bought the gear I needed. 

For those who don't know me personally, I live in the only french speaking province in Canada, without speaking any french. The reason for this is better suited for another article, so we will leave it at that. 

For my course, I had two instructors at the beginning, one being a really french man with a thin pencil mustache who had 50+ years of experience and had been driving motorcycles since he was 15, and one being also an older guy, slightly less french(but still really french) with less experience. The course was every weekend for a couple months in the summer of 2019, throughout the course I kept up my excitement for getting a motorcycle and I was planning to get a new 2020 rebel 500. I eventually completed the course, and passed my first driving test in October of 2019.

#### ***Chapter 4 - Reality***

All winter, I proceeded to watch the used market for motorcycles almost daily, continued watching videos of how to safely drive, watched videos about maintenance, watched videos and read forums of which bike I should get and why. Then after reading the forums, I was convinced that for my first bike, I should buy used, as if I drop it, it doesn't matter as much, and most motorcyclists upgrade after a year or two anyways.

From reading forums I found that the Honda Shadow was my new desire as it was good for beginners but also big enough that I could keep it forever. Then from watching the used market, I found this beautiful 2006 Honda Shadow Aero, black, with only 20k kilometers, and less than half the price of the new rebel 500. I called the owner and was pretty much sold already. The owner was an older lady who was no longer strong enough to ride, so she was letting it go.

I ended up buying the bike, with the help of my Dad and his friend we were able to get it back to my apartment in March so I could change the fluids before the motorcycle season so I was ready to go. From watching the videos, I expected the oil change to be quick and easy, but it took me *much much* longer than I expected.. and was not fun at all. 

I then had to wait for the snow to melt...

At this point we enter the honeymoon phase. The snow had melted and it was time! I began to use my bike on the weekends.. we need to get something at the grocery store? Don't Fret! Give me 10 minutes to gear up, and another few to check my bike out and I was off to grab it. 

I genuinely did enjoy it. I don't want to sound cringe but unlike an automatic car, riding a bike you are truly one with the vehicle and it is fairly entertaining cruising around. 

#### *Chapter 5 - Uggghhhh*

Unfortunately, by this time, Coronavirus lock down was in full swing, and I couldn't ride some of the roads in Gatineau Park, and the border between Quebec and Ontario was guarded and you were not supposed to cross(I did once, but was kind of hesitant to do it a lot). So my options for those nice cruising rides was limited.

When I bought the bike, it came with a passenger seat and backrest with a small rack to store some stuff, I had not put this on yet as I was not able to ride with a passenger yet(or comfortable enough too), so I did not need it. As the summer came however, I was getting ready for my annual fishing trip with my Poppa, normally I catch a ride with my Uncle Kenny, but he was not going this time due to the virus, so my idea was I will ride my bike the 200km~ to my Nanny and Poppas house! To do this I wanted to put the rack on for extra storage(*mistake*!). 

In order to do this, I would need to remove the saddlebags. So I went to take the saddlebags off, and found that the bolts had loctite and some were stripped.... so after struggling for some time and eventually removing them(with the help of my entire body weight), I couldn't put the saddle bags back on and only two of the bolts would still go in...

I then drove the 200km\~ to my Poppas house, bought new bolts, used his tap kit to tap some of the holes, and drove back the 200km\~ home the weekend before the trip, spent more hours at home getting the backrest and saddlebags back on, then drove the 200km~ later in the week for my fishing trip. This was a frustrating experience for me.. 

By this time the I was no longer in the honeymoon phase, and rather than spend the 15\~ minutes to gear up to grab something on my bike, I preferred just walking the \~15 minutes to the closer store. I began not using it for weeks at a time, and my underground parking is extremely dusty, so before I left I would have to clean it on top of the 15 minutes I already had in setup time, and I just wasn't enjoying it as much as I did. 

Now writing this, I have just posted it for up for sale, as I just don't *want* to ride it really.... and why would I do something I don't *want* to do? It's just not for me.. 

Overall, I believe my issue was I did not correctly set my expectations with reality, I was expecting the equivalent of a car, but fun and cooler. I do not regret spending the money, as I checked out the *be a biker* on my bucket list and I now have the right to tell my future kids that I was totally cool with photographic evidence:

In the future when trying to find a hobby, I want to make sure I think about it in reality and set my expectations as such, and if you want to take anything from this rambling, I would also take the same advice... or not ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
