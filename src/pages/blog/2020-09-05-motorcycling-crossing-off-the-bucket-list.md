#### ***Chapter 1 - Playful Beginnings***

To start the story we have to fall back multiple years. I believe this story starts sometime near mid 2018. Me and my friends are having a lot of fun playing a popular game called *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* a.k.a *PUBG*. 

PUBG is a battle royale game. 100 people parachute from a plane into the map, scavenge for gear like weapons and armor, and fight to survive as the map shrinks in size, the last team alive wins. Most of the time you are on foot, however, the game includes vehicles that you can drive, including at the time a UAZ jeep, a Dacia 1300, a Buggy, and most important to this story a Motorcycle and a Motorcycle with a sidecar.

By this time, we had been playing the game for a while, as the game released at the end of 2017 and we were pretty to quick to hop onto the wagon. So at this point, I found we were playing 1 of 2 types of games at any given time. We were either trying really hard to win, or trying reaaaally hard to have fun. Me and my friend Dylan leaning more towards the latter. 

So the thing with *PUBG* is that looking back the game itself wasn't exactly that great.. a lot of bugs, glitches and hackers. The most bugged part of the game being the vehicles. You would lose control of the vehicle with any small piece of uneven terrain, and hitting anything at speed would result in either an explosion or you being forcefully ejected out of the moving vehicle, usually resulting in death.

In most cases, bugs end up being a really bad thing and make the game less fun... but when it came to the vehicles in PUBG, they were so bugged and glitched, that it resulted in extremely funny situations that immediately might not be your desired outcome, as you had just spent the whole game searching for scraps of gear, but it overall ended up being so hilarious it was worth it. 

Me and Dylan picking up on this fact after a while came to the conclusion that the most fun vehicle is the Motorcycle. Why was it the most fun? It being the fastest and smallest vehicle, you were able to do tricks like flips with it! 

So me and Dylan proceeded to hunt for a motorcycle... go to the biggest hill on the map... drive full speed up it while screaming *The Smashing Pumpkins* lyric from the song *Bullet with Butterfly Wings* "THE WORLD IS A VAMPIIIRE" while flipping in the air and proceeding to make air guitar noises while our other two teammates are actually trying to win the game. 

Looking something like this(but sometimes with more smoke coming out of the bike):

This would commonly end in the explosions or ejection as previously mentioned. One of my fondest memories of playing games ever is this few weeks or months of performing this and similar stunts.

This was my first time having fun with motorcycles. 

#### ***Chapter 2 - PUBG's Decline***

We would continue to play the game, slowly playing less and less in favor of other games, still using motorcycles, but not always as stunt men.

One night me and my friends Kevin and Troy are playing, and we all find motorcycles and in discord we begin talking about how fun motorcycles are in the game, and how Troy and Kevin both want to ride together in real life(Troy having his dad's bike, Kevin not yet having one). Me thinking about it at the time thought, ya motorcycles are totally bad-ass and all experiences I have with them are either funny or cool at this point, so I also agree that we should all get bikes one day and ride together. On December 30, 2018, I send the following picture in Snapchat with the caption "*Reenactment of Me, Kevin and Troy 2k19*":

#### ***Chapter 3 -  Maybe It's Actually For Me?***

Sometime in 2018  When exactly? I am not sure.. but one of the things I liked and still like to do is watch Youtube videos. Over the span of a couple months, while falling into whatever Youtube holes I stumbled to in 2018, I was recommended videos like "*Bikers are awesome compilation #32*" or "*Bikers vs Cops episode #23243*" which I watched and enjoyed. Once Youtube recognized I was liking these motorcycle compilations, eventually it started to recommended channels like [WALTERRIFIC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl41VS1Nqxd3HnR-JyPA-tQ),
