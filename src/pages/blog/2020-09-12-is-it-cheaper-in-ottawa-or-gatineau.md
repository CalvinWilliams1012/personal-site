This is simply a look at the **cost** of living in Gatineau vs Ottawa, and does not account for differences such as healthcare.

# Housing

Housing is generally the most expensive thing in someones life, and if you just take a look at the housing cost in Gatineau and Ottawa you immediately see a huge difference. Luckily the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation runs a [Rental Market Survey](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/RmsMethodology) and a [Secondary Rental Market Survey](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/SrmsMethodology) and then publishes data tables on this which can be [found here](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/data-and-research/data-tables/rental-market-report-data-tables). 

Checking the data, we see two different numbers. One being the the average two bedroom rent from the rental market survey (RMS), and one being the average two bedroom rent for rental condo apartments, which I believe is from the Secondary Rental Market Survey.

From the RMS numbers we see that Gatineau's average rent was **$874**, and the average two bedroom rent in Ottawa was **$1410**. This shows us that the difference between Ottawa and Gatineau is **$536**, or **62%**.

From the other mentioned numbers, two bedroom rental condo apartments in Gatineau were an average of **$1054** and in Ottawa were an average of **$1720**, the difference being **$666**, or **61%**.

From this, I believe we can take the difference between the two percentages and surmise that the **rent in Ottawa is ~61.5% higher than Gatineau**. However this percentage does not give us a real number to use when trying to find if it is cheaper for us to live in Ottawa or Gatineau, so we can just take the average between the two. If we use the average, we can say that **rent in Gatineau is** **$601 cheaper that Ottawa**. Taking account that rent is a monthly expense, we can look at it as rent Gatineau being **$7212 cheaper per year**.

# Income Taxes

Another huge difference between the provinces is the income taxes. Quebec has much higher income tax rates. To find the actual difference between the taxes you personally would pay in the two provinces you can use income tax calculators like [SimpleTaxes here](https://simpletax.ca/calculator). Enter your income into the calculator, then use the drop down to select between the two provinces to see the difference.

For the sake of illustration, I will show the difference at three different income levels, **$50000**, **$100000**, and **$150000**:

At an income of **$50000**, **Ontario income tax is $2210 cheaper**.

At an income of **$100000**, **Ontario income tax is $5563 cheaper**.

At an income of **$150000**, **Ontario income tax is $7910 cheaper**.

This made me interested in the salary that would make up for the difference in rent, this number is $132,750, at an income of **$132,750**, **Ontario income tax is** **$7212 cheaper per year.** If we only use the rental and income tax numbers, would mean that if you earn below **$132,750**, it is cheaper to live in Gatineau, and if you earn above, it is cheaper in Ottawa.

# Insurance and Registration

Income Tax and Housing is not the only difference! The insurance and registration costs in Ottawa and Gatineau differ greatly, and while using only the rent and income tax difference would be a reasonable estimate, we can further quantify which is cheaper.
