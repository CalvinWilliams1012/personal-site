This is simply a look at the **cost** of living in Gatineau vs Ottawa, and does not account for differences such as healthcare, services, language, etc.

***Edit*** - *March 2021*: I wrote a post about the [quality of life differences between the two sides here](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2021-03-19-gatineau-vs-ottawa-quality-of-life/). 

# Housing

Housing is generally the most expensive thing in someones life, and if you just take a look at the housing cost in Gatineau and Ottawa you immediately see a huge difference. Luckily the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation runs a [Rental Market Survey](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/RmsMethodology) and a [Secondary Rental Market Survey](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/SrmsMethodology) and then publishes data tables on this which can be [found here](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/data-and-research/data-tables/rental-market-report-data-tables). 

Checking the data, we see two different numbers. One being the the average two bedroom rent from the rental market survey (RMS), and one being the average two bedroom rent for rental condo apartments, which I believe is from the Secondary Rental Market Survey.

From the RMS numbers we see that Gatineau's average rent was **$874**, and the average two bedroom rent in Ottawa was **$1410**. This shows us that the difference between Ottawa and Gatineau is **$536**, or **62%**.

From the other mentioned numbers, two bedroom rental condo apartments in Gatineau were an average of **$1054** and in Ottawa were an average of **$1720**, the difference being **$666**, or **61%**. 

![Ottawa vs Gatineau Rent Table 2](/img/table2ottawagatineau2019.png "Ottawa vs Gatineau Rent Table 2")

From this, I believe we can take the difference between the two percentages and surmise that the **rent in Ottawa is ~61.5% higher than Gatineau**. However this percentage does not give us a real number to use when trying to find if it is cheaper for us to live in Ottawa or Gatineau, so we can just take the average between the two. If we use the average, we can say that **rent in Gatineau is** **$601 cheaper that Ottawa**. Taking account that rent is a monthly expense, we can look at it as rent Gatineau being **$7212 cheaper per year**.

# Income Taxes

Another huge difference between the provinces is the income taxes. Quebec has much higher income tax rates. To find the actual difference between the taxes you personally would pay in the two provinces you can use income tax calculators like [SimpleTaxes here](https://simpletax.ca/calculator). Enter your income into the calculator, then use the drop down to select between the two provinces to see the difference.

For the sake of illustration, I will show the difference at three different income levels, **$50000**, **$100000**, and **$150000**:

At an income of **$50000**, **Ontario income tax is $2210 cheaper**.

At an income of **$100000**, **Ontario income tax is $5563 cheaper**.

At an income of **$150000**, **Ontario income tax is $7910 cheaper**.

This made me interested in the salary that would make up for the difference in rent, this number is $132,750, at an income of **$132,750**, **Ontario income tax is** **$7212 cheaper per year.** If we only use the rental and income tax numbers, would mean that if you earn below **$132,750**, it is cheaper to live in Gatineau, and if you earn above, it is cheaper in Ottawa.

# Insurance, Registration, and Licensing

Income Tax and Housing is not the only difference! The insurance and registration costs in Ottawa and Gatineau differ greatly, and while using only the rent and income tax difference would be a reasonable estimate, we can further quantify which is cheaper.

[According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada](http://www.ibc.ca/bc/resources/media-centre/media-releases/bc-drivers-continue-to-pay-the-highest-auto-insurance-premiums-in-canada), the average auto premium in Quebec is **$717** and the average in Ontario is **$1,505**. I also however found other sources specific to Gatineau and Ottawa stating slightly different numbers, for example [this source stating Gatineau average premiums are](https://www.ratelab.ca/insurance/car/quebec/) **$560,** and [this source stating average Ottawa premium](https://www.ratehub.ca/insurance/car/ottawa) 'is just shy of **$1,600**', however the numbers of the IBC seem more reliable, so we will use those.

The cost to renew your license in Ontario and Quebec is similar, with the [renewal in Quebec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/drivers-licence/cost-renewing-licence/) being **$86.34**, and the [renewal in Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/driver-and-vehicle-fees) being **$90**. However in Quebec, the number of demerit points you have increases this cost.	

The vehicle registration between the provinces also differs, [with Quebec being](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/cost-registration-renewal/passenger-vehicles/) **$272.57**, some of this cost is due to being in Gatineau, which increases the cost to due a required [Public Transit Contribution](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/cost-registration-renewal/passenger-vehicles/contribution-public-transit/). I additionally would like to note that in Quebec they tack you with more small fees that could cause the exact cost to differ, see: <https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/fees-vehicle-registration/>

However in Ontario, the total cost is **$179**, this being the Licence plate (new and replacement), with permit at **$59** and the Licence plate sticker being **$120** (Southern Ontario)

The total cost just using the numbers above for insurance registration and licensing in **Gatineau would be $1075.91,** while **Ontario would be** **$1774.** Making **Gatineau $698.09 cheaper**. With the additional fees this would most likely be a slightly smaller difference, and the insurance premium is an average and may differ from person to person, but the number is a good example.

# Child care

Another considerable cost is child care. This expense has a large difference between Ottawa and Gatineau. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives publishes a ["Child care fees in Canadaâ€™s big cities" study](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/newsroom/news-releases/study-reveals-highest-and-lowest-child-care-fees-canadian-cities-2018). This has the average cost of childcare for Infants, Toddlers and Preschool, see the table:

![Daycare table](/img/daycaredatagatineauottawa.png "Daycare table")

As we can see, the cost in Gatineau is much, much less. The reason for this is Quebec has subsidized childcare with a set reduced rate ($8.25 in 2019 or $8.35 in 2020) and non-subsidized childcare that you receive a refundable tax credit between 75% and 26% of eligible childcare expenses paid, depending on family income. You can enter your income using the [calculator available here](http://www.budget.finances.gouv.qc.ca/budget/outils/garde_en.asp).

Using the averages from the study, Gatineau is **$765/month cheaper for Infant childcare**, **$819/month cheaper for Toddler childcare** and **$817/month cheaper for Preschool childcare**. Over a year this results in **$9180 to $9828 in savings in** Gatineau.

# [](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/data-and-research/data-tables/rental-market-report-data-tables)Overall

From my research, overall, if you have a child, it is almost certainly cheaper to live in Gatineau, if you do not have a child, then it is a little more dependent on income. 

You can calculate even more costs but I believe they are much less significant, for example, sales tax in Quebec is 14.98%, but Ontario is 13%, which is very little day to day(and you could just shop across the border), but may be significant if making large purchases. Another example is the Ontario Land Transfer Tax Refund for First Time Home buyers, which is not available in Quebec, or Quebec electric vehicle rebate that is not available in Ontario.

If you only care about the cost of where you live(*which I don't recommend!*), you should calculate the difference between the actual costs given your actual situation, using the resources above.
