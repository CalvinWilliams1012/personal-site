Just to preface this, here is a collage of some of my accounts game time:

![game times](/img/game-time.png "game times")

* **CS:GO**: 1867 hrs + 962 hrs + more from other accounts..
* **League of Legends**: 1085 hrs.. IN RANKED. Riot does not track game time and only ranked stats can be pulled, so this number is most likely 4k+
* **Path of Exile**: 2000+ hrs

Games that I am unable to find stats on are my Modern Warfare 2 and various other xbox games, which are 30+ days at least. I am also unable to tell how much time I have spent on Minecraft, which would be far greater than any other game listed.

So you can see that I played a lot of video games (and I still play a lot of video games).

To be completely and utterly honest video games were my escape and I am very thankful that I was able to use them, I did not enjoy nearly anything about the real world for some time and getting on the game allowed me to "take my coat off at the door" and forget about any issues I had.

This however.. is not healthy.. if you can't bear the real world you should try and change things so that you can not only bear it but enjoy it, rather than running away.

The problem with this is that changing things in the real world is DIFFICULT while video games reward you for little to nothing.

# **Enter the Video Game**

You download a game and normally have to start with a tutorial. If you are new to playing video games you most likely spend the time learning the game and following the tutorial.. or if you are accustomed to playing games most of the time you just try and get through it as quick as possible. Most of the time after these first few minutes you are already rewarded with something and you can easily see your level increase. Then for the first few levels you normally introduced to new mechanics of the game you can use as you become more skilled which is clearly marked by a level and you can even see what you will get in the future at *level X,* for example*:*

In most games playing well results in achieving the results faster. So you want to get better or win more as this will help you achieve the various accolades in the game that you can see on the horizon.

As you get better and better, the game normally then allows you to play a ranked system where you can easily see your rank and compete to get a better rank.

# **Enter the Real World**

For this example we will compare learning a new skill to a new game. Just like a video game when you want to start a new skill you usually follow some form of tutorial -- this being in the form of a class or course, or even a YouTube video you follow. I believe learning curves look something like this:

![learning curve](/img/learningcurve.jpg "learning curve")

where you start out slow, have a steep acceleration and then plateau. This is really unlike games, where they immediately try to hook you in, they want you to play them, where in the real world you may be discouraged at the start due to failing at the start. 

If we use this knowledge curve assumption then after the real life "tutorial" you have in some cases such as learning an instrument.. almost nothing and at best if for example you are doing something like a painting class you may have something physical. We will go with the best scenario where you have something physical that you look at and get excited that you were able to make such a cool thing and you want to continue.

but.. what's the next step...? Well that's the thing.. you can do whatever you want in the real world, so the next step is up to you. You can research the next step and get opinions on your next step, and in the best cases like a full fledged course may already have additional classes and steps, but already, we can see that life has no hard lines or definitions which does make it more difficult to see the next step.

Lets go with the assumption that you have your next steps defined, over the next **weeks and months** you continue on the path and unlock the new mechanics of the skill and progressively get better and better. You can see I highlighted the time above, as the real world takes time to learn things, while this in a good game takes much less time, the way I like to look at it is that each step in real life may be weeks apart while in a video game it may be hours apart. So if you are just looking for achievement and you can choose to achieve something every few hours or every few weeks..... it is easy to take the path of least resistance and do the hourly thing.

Lets jump back to our example and assume you now finished your course! Congrats! You have officially learned the skill! Just as before you look ahead and the next step is yet again up to you. You then determine your next step forward and define your own next 'level'. This may be getting a job doing the skill, or maybe selling your service or product created from the skill, or you may have not know your next step.. I didn't.

# **Failure**

I want to now talk about failure. In both the real world and games you can fail, in both cases this can be because you were not yet prepared for the challenge.. or it could be that you did everything right but it just didn't work out. No fault of your own.

The thing with failure in video games is that it is yet again **fast**. You enter a League of Legends game, you do well in your lane but your team mates end up losing theirs and you end up losing the game. 15-40 minutes and you have failed. How do you get over this failure? You may feel defeated, but you can just jump to the next game, in seconds you can go ahead and start over.

In real life, lets go back to you finishing the course and you are now looking for a job doing this skill. You spruce up your resume and submit it on some job postings, maybe you get a few calls back and you get an interview for next week! Nice!

You dress your best and practice your skill in advance to ensure you are ready to demonstrate that you spent your time learning the skill and are the right one for the job! You go to the interview and... it doesn't work out.. you don't know why.. you are confident in your skills but you assume they just picked someone else. You feel defeated but what are your next steps? More time applying to jobs.. more phone calls.. and maybe you try and get another interview. You can see that this 'chasm' is much larger and making each 'jump' is more difficult, I believe the 'chasm' you need to jump in real life is large, while the one in video games are small:

![chasms between failure](/img/chasms.png "chasms between failure")

Due to the chasm being much larger, you have a much greater chance of "falling" or giving up. 

# **Rambling Conclusion**

When I try to 'level up' in a game, I see the next level, I know what I have to do to achieve that level, and I can achieve it usually pretty quickly.

When I try to 'level up' in real life, the next level is sometimes unknown and I have to find it, once found I am unsure of how to achieve it and need to also find that, and the achievement takes more time.

You may think this is a bad outlook, but really the difference is that you have freedom to do what you wish in the real world. You have some of this in video games, but you walk down a path for a predefined achievement where as in the real world you do not, you have complete freedom to pick not only your own path but also you have the ability to plan the next level or achievement for yourself.

When I was younger, I guess I was just looking for purpose and to achieve something and found the shortest way that made me feel good. With some more life experience my video gaming has turned more into casual leisure with my friends rather than my purpose :)
