This question might not be as easy as you think.. At its face we can look at the average salary in Canada, and compare it to the USA.. done right? Nope, we have to account for a different currency, different taxes, different benefits from those taxes, and different costs of living. Lets start! All of this is based on the current numbers I can find at the time of writing this(Maybe I can do a yearly edition).

# Compensation

Depending on the source you look at, the average software developer in Canada earns between $66,545 - $90,000 CAD a year\[1,2,3,4]. If we take the average of the four averages I found, we end up with **$76,614.5 CAD.** We can chop the numbers up in a million different ways, but I believe that this is a good number that is most likely "close enough".

Now lets look at the number for the USA. For this I used three of the same sources(payscale, glassdoor, and indeed) and one strictly American source(stackoverflow survey) as above I used one strictly Canadian source(neuvoo)\[5,6,7,8].  This gives us numbers between $86,222 - $115,000 USD. Taking the average of the four averages we arrive at **$100,158.25 USD**.

# Currency Exchange

We then have to look at the currency exchange between the Canadian and American dollar. Our **$76,614.5 CAD** turns into **$58,305.93 USD** at current exchange rates\[9]. The numbers are fairly obvious so far.. if you are a Canadian and are looking for money, the USA average is almost double the Canadian.

# Taxes

How much of this is actually being taken home? Well as taxes are complicated.. and based on Provinces or States it is difficult to give a concrete dollar amount on the difference, if we go ahead and just assume that a Software Developer in the US is in California and a Software Developer in Canada is in Ontario our Canadian assumption would pay 25.10% effective income tax rate\[10], with our American assumption paying a 28.96% effective income tax rate\[11]. So the Californian would pay more taxes, but they would end up with **$71,150** **USD** but ourOntarian would still end up with only **$43,665.49 USD.** The higher US income results in higher taxes.. if the Canadian compensation matched the USA, then the effective tax rate would increase greatly.

We could also just look at the average effective tax rate which according to investopedia is 28% for Canada and 18% for the USA\[12]. Also according to them

> *"if you make less than $84,200 and do not own a home, you will most likely pay less tax north of the border."*

\[13]

We however can't glance over the fact that the Canadian taxes pay for healthcare, while in the US, you need to pay for health insurance. Generally this may be a benefit from your employer but you are still required to pay, on average the employee premium is $1,242 USD for an individual and $6,015 USD for a family\[14]. This will increase greatly if you do not have this benefit, but due to the lower compensation in Canada, the US still comes out on top financially.

# Cost of Living

The final aspect I would like to look at is the cost of living difference. Similar to taxes, this is difficult to give you an exact number as the middle of Nebraska and San Francisco will have different costs of living, but we are generalizing so lets go with Numbeo who rates cost of living on an index\[15].

If we look at Numbeo it seems that the cost of living is slightly higher in the US vs Canada as the USA ranks at 71.47, and Canada ranks at 66.98.

# Summary

Overall:

In the USA a Software developer would make on average **$71,150.00** **USD** after tax, without subtracting health insurance premiums, and without accounting for a *slightly* higher cost of living. 

In Canada a Software developer would make on average **$43,665.49 USD** after tax, without adjusting for a slightly lower cost of living.

This is honestly closer than I thought it would be, for example if we subtract the $6,015 USD estimate from the health insurance premium estimate we are at $65,135.00 USD compared to $43,665.49 USD which is around ~$20000 USD/year difference. One also must not only make the choice on where to live based on the amount of money you make but also the quality of life and other social aspects, but here are the numbers if you are looking to squeeze some money out of the system, move to the US.
