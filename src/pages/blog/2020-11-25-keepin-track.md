# Over in a Blink

The older I get the more I realize how fast life is going. You always get told as a kid by older people how fast life went by them and.. you just don't really believe them because your summer vacation lasts so long that you begin to get bored!

Then almost like you are accelerating in a car at some point you realize that this is starting to go by much faster. Your years as an adult just start to blend together, at least for me in the last few years working a 9 to 5. You don't really have anything separating time periods anymore, just work 5 times a week have 2 days off, enjoy your time and maybe get a couple vacations in a year. The exception is for large life events like buying a house, getting married, kids, etc.. you can differentiate periods in time by these events. 

I think this is one contributing factor to why time goes by faster as an adult. As a kid you had set grades with summer breaks in between, large transitions every couple years from kindergarten to elementary to high school to college, all of these give you a kind of reference point and at the time.. they seem to last forever.

# Journaling

I think I fairly quickly realized that maybe I could try something to slow this down, get a better grasp on things and maybe improve my life. So I bought a journal, because I thought that if I write down what I did today that I could then look back every week/month/year and it would slow everything down, give me a better picture of where I am going and ability to redirect course.

When I first got the journal, I would frequent [/r/Journaling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/), try and write every night what I did during the day and my mood and such.. which kind of worked for a little while.. but it would take 30+ minutes to write anything meaningful, and honestly... my days were not really worth writing home about. 

I would have entries that explained something I did at work that I really didn't want to remember but on that day it was important to me or I would have meaningful entries but they would be like 4 pages long, which maybe a few years from now would be interesting but I was not looking to read a book I wrote for myself every month and spend 200+ minutes a week doing so. 

So I dropped the journaling thing... it might be good for some people but was not for me.

# A Plan

Where was I redirecting myself to? A bad plan is better than no plan! I then decided to make a life plan, as if I have a general idea of where I am going, goals I want to hit, places I want to be, then not only will I be able to slow everything down but I could improve myself as anything you don't track isn't real ;)

I am still only a few months into this, but I feel like it is going OK, I am achieving the things I set out for myself and adjusting as I see fit, as it is ***my*** plan. I decided to use two documents, a flow chart I created using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) with columns for years, and small entries that have a simple title and reference number for the goal, and each entry has arrows going to the next entries.

I then have a google doc with those reference numbers with a 1-2 paragraph explanation of each goal/entry. 

I don't really have a set time I check back in with myself and review what I have done, but I am finding that I am checking it about every month, which seems like a good time frame so far due to the scope of my goals being over years.

# Video Journaling

My next idea, and the reason I am writing this post is that I still feel like while I now have the plan going forward, I am still kind of lacking the tracking part, both for goal keeping and just for memories.

My idea was that once a week, I take my phone, sit down, and talk about the important events in my week and how I felt about it.

As I mentioned above, I felt like journaling took too much time every day. In the video format, if I limit it to 5 or 10 minutes, it then only takes 5 or 10 minutes and it then syncs with my google cloud my phone is linked to. No additional production time, just record and forget until its time to look back.

I also mentioned that some days I really didn't have anything interesting, which is why I decided on weekly, as I think that at the very least every week I have one interesting thing that happened that I can talk about.

I also talked about how I didn't want to read a book every month about myself, in this format, I have 260 minutes a year of video, or only 20 minutes a month as you can pack much more into a video then you can pack into a notebook.

I am starting this starting next Sunday, and will in a couple months post a retrospective about how it went, but I think it is a good idea.
