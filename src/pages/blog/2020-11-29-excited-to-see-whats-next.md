# This Tech Stuff is Kinda Cool

I recently bought a house, and as someone who is interested in technology I plan on slowly making my home into a smart home! I already moved in with a couple google home mini's -- and I do have [Philips hue lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y3QXSGX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B06Y3QXSGX&linkCode=as2&tag=calvinwilli01-20&linkId=f20f5b4a44ec5548b911c73f5b4cf144) that I also brought with me but I have not installed those yet, but that is better for a different post! 

When I bought the house, I had to switch the utilities from the previous owner to me. When on the natural gas companies website I saw that they had some programs going where you could get $100 for buying and installing a smart thermostat if you had an existing non-smart/programmable thermostat.

This house did not have a smart thermostat so I was totally going to jump on this with the knowledge of the new [Nest Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HRPDYTP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08HRPDYTP&linkCode=as2&tag=calvinwilli01-20&linkId=12239eb7e87f68e1acc1e04c323971b0) being released for only $179+tax. I waited until black friday to see if it went on sale, unfortunately it did not, but then I bought it.

I just installed it, really simple only took 30 to 40 minutes and I do not consider myself handy(yet). I am not a fan of the [backplate they sell](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HRPH645/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08HRPH645&linkCode=as2&tag=calvinwilli01-20&linkId=6916c169dce0b523b2f18ecaefaab25e).. but that is again not for this post. I know it is kinda funny but this thermostat is so cool, I have been telling everyone I talk to about it! I set my home app with my girlfriend and we now have it so that the temperature goes down when both of us are not close to home(albeit, only by 1.5c because we do have a cat, and want him to be comfortable), and I also have our schedule set up so we have it colder at night for sleeping. 

To me though one cool part is it is just a mirror until you approach it and it shows the temperature... it is just such a neat feature..

# Yeah, Yeah.. Get to the Point

Now to the point of this post. I am really excited to see what the next upcoming technologies are. I think back to when I was a kid, which to be fair was not that long ago as I am only 23 at the time I am writing this, and the technology was not even on the same plane of existence of the new technologies we have today.

Lets look at the year I was born, 1997. The internet was ***new***. DVD's were ***new***. Netscape and Internet explorer were the browsers people ***chose*** to use. Apple purchased NeXT bringing Steve Jobs back. The google domain name is ***registered***. PalmPilots were released with ***512 KBs*** of memory! ***"High speed"*** 56Kbps modems started arriving. Screens were upgrading to ***800Ã—600*** resolutions!

Now lets fast forward to today, on black friday my friend purchased a new ***1TB*** m.2 ssd that can reach up to ***4GB/s* for $80.** He also was lucky enough to be able to buy a new graphics card with 10GB of ***VRAM***. ***5G*** mobile networks and smart phones are becoming the normal. You can control your ***entire house*** from your phone, even appliances!!! We have ***virtual reality headsets*** that you can interact with! We are in an ***autonomous vehicle*** revolution! We can land our space ships back on the earth after launch!! Artificial Intelligence is being applied and improving!!

I am missing a lot of stuff, but you get the point.. We went from the internet just being created, no search engines, computers with MBs/KBs of memory to the modern technology of today, all in less than the average lifespan of a personal, almost half actually..

With this stated, I am extremely excited to see what is next, what is the next smart phone? Will we see space tourism? Will we continue to use AI? Will humans start to integrate with technology? Will VR advance far enough that we no longer have monitors or televisions?!?

I have no idea.. but it's pretty cool to think about what I am going to see in the future, and I am already enjoying what we have now.
