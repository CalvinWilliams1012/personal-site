As someone who is interested in personal finance, I believe I see a couple more government programs or various incentives than the average Canadian. When  I tell others about programs, some people seem to act like I am taking advantage of the companies or government... 

These programs do not involve digging through legislation and finding loopholes, these programs involve visiting a website, following some steps, filling out some forms, and benefitting!

# My Smart Thermostat

I recently purchased a house, before closing I had to switch the natural gas provider over to my name. The natural gas provider is [Gazifere](https://www.gazifere.com/en/), when switching I was browsing the site looking for any programs they had as I know that various energy incentives exist. Very obviously on the front page it has "Cash incentives". This gives you a PDF with the various incentives, most of these are for expensive items such as furnaces, hot water tanks, fireplaces... not really interesting unless you are already looking for one.. but I saw that they offered a $100 rebate for a smart thermostat!

Being interested in tech, I already knew that these weren't *that* expensive.. and their purpose is partly to save you money... For example, the [Nest Thermostat 3rd Generation](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B012R8MVHC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=B012R8MVHC&linkCode=as2&tag=calvinwilli06-20&linkId=13b3b72ddfce11af918444d9195e19ef) is only $259 right now on sale.. with tax this would come to ~$300, with the rebate this is $200 for a thermostat that saves "[about 10-12% on their heating bills and about 15% on their cooling bills](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9241995?hl=en#gbwa:~:text=On%20average%20the%20Nest%20thermostat%20saved,details%2C%20visit%20our%20comprehensive%20white%20paper.)". 

I however found the new [Nest Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HRPDYTP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08HRPDYTP&linkCode=as2&tag=calvinwilli01-20&linkId=50f44c7f30e9aac6f051a3e53d827b03), which is even cheaper.. it is lacking some features but I should gain similar savings from it. This process involved filling out a preadmission form, buying the thermostat, then sending them the proof of purchase along with the install date. That's it.

# Use Them!

Based off my above example, you can see that these programs are a no brainer, I spent a very small amount of time finding it, just a few more minutes on the site I was already on. I also occasionally find them when browsing various personal finance forums.. for example I found the [CMHC Green Home](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/buying/mortgage-loan-insurance-for-consumers/cmhc-green-home) incentive which could give you a 25% CMHC insurance premium refund for improving your homes energy efficiency. While this program takes some more time, and most likely isn't worth doing just for the sake of the program, if you are already buying new windows or you are already going to purchase a new hot water heater/furnace.. why not spend the time to get your house evaluated([for FREE right now in Quebec](https://transitionenergetique.gouv.qc.ca/en/residential/programs/renoclimat/energy-evaluation)), and then you might be able to get a couple thousand dollars back.. You also could double dip with rebates offered by your energy provider.. 

It makes me sad to think their are people who are not aware of these programs and could be saving a fairly huge amount of money that them and their family could use. If this doesn't convince you to occasionally look for incentives, or just look before large purchases... I don't know what will.. thousands of your hard earned dollars are at stake :)
