I am 23 years old, have my drivers license, have a well paying job, but do not have a car.

# Benefits of a Car.

The benefits of a car are fairly obvious. You have freedom of movement wherever you want. Need to go to the grocery store 10km away? Hop in the car. Want to go for a weekend camping trip 200km away? Hop in the car. In a continent built around automobiles.. you don't have to look that far to see that everything is designed for the car owner.

# Then Why Not Have One?

Being 23 years old with I hope many years left, I would like to take advantage of compounding interest and I like to try and look what luxury I can cut out in order to save my self money now, which turns into 10x or more over the time period I will be investing.

When we look at the cost of a car, along with the fact I live in a city in the technology age, it just does not make sense for me currently to purchase a car.

The cost of car ownership includes:

* Purchase price and financing
* Insurance
* License + Registration
* Gas/Electricity
* Maintenance 

and you also may need to consider:

* Parking
* Deprecation

# The Math

According to [AutoTrader](https://www.autotrader.ca/newsfeatures/20200512/april-2020-price-index-results-released/), the average new car is ***$28328*** and the average used car is ***$14999.*** This is a automatically a large amount of money, but lets say you didn't have the cash in hand and needed to finance, for example $5000 down and finance the rest. With new cars you may be able to get a low rate, lets say 2%, and you went with 4 years on the loan. This would be ***$500 interest*** in the first year alone and total around ***$964.99*** if we use Ontario sales tax for the purchase, more if we do Quebec sales tax. With used cars, if you don't have cash I recommend you save until you do because the financing is most likely not worth it.

We then need to get insurance. The average car insurance [for 23 year olds in Ontario](https://www.myinsurancebroker.com/insurance/car-insurance/resources/average-cost-of-car-insurance-by-age/) is **$3,216 - $4,884**, I would be somewhere around average I believe as I am a male, so my rate goes up, but I also have no previous claims/accidents. This is also much less in Quebec due to the no fault insurance, and most likely less than half of the above number.

Now lets look at all the other small costs. it would be over ***$250*** for licensing and registration, see here [for Quebec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/cost-registration-renewal/passenger-vehicles/) and here [for Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/register-vehicle-permit-licence-plate-and-sticker). It would be on average ***$1742*** a year in gas, according to [National Resources Canada](https://fcr-ccc.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/en). For maintenance we are looking at** *$500-700*** a year [according to CAA](https://www.caa.ca/canadians-unclear-about-the-true-cost-of-owning-a-vehicle/).

We are looking at over ***$10000/year*** total for car ownership. All for a depreciating asset.

# Personal Choice

In some places, you have no choice, you need to buy a car to exist. However if you live in a city, you most likely do not need a car and it is more a luxury. This depends on many factors like how distant the stores you need to visit are from your home, the quality of public transport and ride share services, the availability of either rental cars or friends/family in the absolute need of a car.

For me, I would consider it insane for me personally to buy a car for myself. I live 2 blocks from a grocery store, 4 from a pharmacy and post office, and 6 from a hardware store. With many others businesses not mentioned also within similar distances. 

This ***$10000*** a year instead is invested, and this ten thousand invested every year over 30 years turns into ***$693,271.44*** with a conservative 5% rate of return compounding monthly. If we follow the 4% rule, this nest egg would allow you to spend ***$27730.85/year*** in retirement. I hope that explains why I don't own a car :)

If my life however changes and I move somewhere where I require a car to get to work or for other purposes, then obviously I would buy one. Until then, retirement becomes closer and closer.
