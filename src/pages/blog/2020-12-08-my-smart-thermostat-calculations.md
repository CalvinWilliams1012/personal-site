I recently purchased a the new [Nest Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HRPDYTP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08HRPDYTP&linkCode=as2&tag=calvinwilli01-20&linkId=9e2c5b1521e813953d9f598972f74ee4). I am interested in technology so I mostly did this as I thought it was pretty cool that you could control your thermostat from your other devices, but I also found that their was no reason for me not to do it.

# Cost Breakdown

The Nest Thermostat costs **$179.99** Canadian Dollar(CAD). I waited to see if it would go on sale this Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but as it is new, it did not go on sale. So the cost of the thermostat is $179.99 plus tax, I however also chose to add on the backplate for an extra $19.99 to cover up the previous thermostats holes/unpainted areas. I regret buying the backplate however, as it is:

1. Ugly
2. Doesn't cover up my old thermostat's unpainted area

So the backplate was a waste of money.. but I did buy it.

The sales tax in Quebec is 14.975%, so we take our item price and multiply by 1.14975 for a total cost of **$206.94** if you correctly choose to not buy the backplate, or a whopping **$229.93** if you are buying it with the backplate.

Installation is free, Google provides simple steps for installing the thermostat! If you really don't feel comfortable installing it yourself, you can pay someone to install it... As someone who is not very handy(yet) I can say though that it is VERY easy to install so you should do it yourself :)

# Savings Breakdown

We are starting with the large sum of **$229.93.** I heat my house with natural gas using the company [Gazif√®re](https://www.gazifere.com/en/). This company offers a $100 cash incentive for installing a smart thermostat, it was a simple web form that I filled out, waited to be accepted into, and then I sent them my proof of purchase and installation date and I was credited the $100, more details on the program can be found here: <https://www.gazifere.com/en/gazifere-green/smart-thermostat/>

Similar programs are offered in other provinces or through other providers, for example see:

**Quebec**:

* $100 - <https://www.energir.com/en/residential/customer-centre/reduce-my-consumption/energy-efficiency-grants/thermostat-intelligent/>
* $100 - <https://showmethegreen.ca/home/home-improvement/quebec-gazmetro-smart-thermostat-grant/>

**Ontario**:

* $75 - <https://enbridgesmartsavings.com/smart-thermostats>

**British Columbia**:

* $75 - <https://nest.com/ca/energy-partners/bchydro/>

and you can find many more simply by google searching "Smart thermostat rebate {*Insert where you live here*}".

So just off this incentive alone, I have the price now at **$129.93** or **$106.94** if you didn't buy the backplate.

According to Nest thermostat saved its US customers 10-12% on heating bills, and 15% on cooling bills, see the details and whitepaper here: <https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9241995?hl=en>

They also say that they estimate this to **$131** to **$145** **USD** a year in savings. This is in the US, so currently with the exchange this would be **$167.55** - **$185.46** **CAD** savings per year. So for me, if we use the lower estimate, in 77.5% of a year, the thermostat would have payed for itself. That is only ***283 days***!! So for me, for a $230 investment upfront, I received 50% of the amount in about 2 weeks, and as for the remaining $130, it will pay for itself entirely by September 2021, then I will get 10-15% savings in my pocket from then on. 

# Conclusion

With the rebate it is a no brainer, but even without the rebate, in only two years it will pay for itself. Not only will it pay for itself, the way you are saving money is by reducing your energy use, which in turn reduces your emissions, so not only is it good for you, it is also good for the environment. ***Buy a smart thermostat!*** I am liking my Nest so far, [buy one here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HRPDYTP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08HRPDYTP&linkCode=as2&tag=calvinwilli01-20&linkId=9e2c5b1521e813953d9f598972f74ee4)!
