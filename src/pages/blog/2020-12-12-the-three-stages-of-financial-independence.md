I see financial independence as three distinct sections.. and this part I am on now isn't that fun.

# Part 1 : Unknowing and Excited

Maybe you just started a job where you are getting more money that you ever have before, or maybe this starts from you being tired of living paycheck to paycheck. Indifferent of what brings you to this part.. you are interested in improving your financial situation and you begin researching and learning with wide eyes.

You learn about the ETFs and the think "Wait it just grows?"... what about taxes? Well the government offers these tax advantages accounts, how cool! Well what do I pick? Well that is dependent on your situation! You save up your emergency fund, you feel GREAT! Maybe you even pay off some of your debts in this stage, credit cards, car loans, maybe even student loans, it is awesome!

You continue consuming and consuming and consuming the knowledge, every day you are looking at the new posts in the personal finance or FI discussion board of your choice interested in what others are talking about.

Then...

# Part 2 : The Boring Middle

You have your emergency fund, you have your accounts set up so that the withdraw and subsequent investment is automatic, you have been like this for a few months now.. and the next steps? Next new things to learn?

Well... not much else to learn unless something new comes out... you already have everything set up.. now you just  let it grow..

I am at this point and I realized that well, this is just something on the side I leave on autopilot as I go about my day to day life, you can try to increase your income and reduce expenses some more here, and you most likely will do one or the other in this huge middle period... but it just is boring and not interesting in general.

# Part 3 : Freedom

I have not yet hit this period, but at this point, you reached your amount. Your investments now cover your expenses. You did it, you reached the finish line.

Now what? Some people fall into the "one more year" syndrome, others retire the day they hit this number.. At this point it is specific to each individual, because they are FREE. They can now if they so wish, do what they want.

While I believe that I may not be as excited in this period, I can just imagine the peace of mind and serenity this would bring. Knowing that if you didn't make another dollar you could just.. exist.

# Conclusion

Enjoy the beginning, understand the middle, and do whatever you god damn feel like in the end.
