# The Second US Stimulus Bill

The United States has just passed the second US Stimulus bill through senate. This bill is for **$900 Billion**. With the key provisions being:

* Up to $600 Direct Payments.
* $284 billion PPP Loans.
* $15 billion "in dedicated funding for live venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions".
* $300/week enhanced unemployment benefits.
* Tax credit "to support employers offering paid sick leave".
* $82 billion for schools and colleges.
* $25 billion for eviction moratorium + rental assistance.
* $10 billion for child care.
* $13 billion for nutrition programs.
* $7 billion for broadband.
* Vaccine distribution

# Break It Down

## Direct Payments

$600 Direct Payments is about the US Minimum Wage for 80 hours of work\[2]. $600 does not coverage the average rent for one month, not only if we use the entire US average which includes extremely high cost areas\[3]... but it does not cover the average rent in a SINGLE STATE \[4]! Kansas? Idaho? Ohio? Iowa? All of them over $600 average rent.

## PPP Loans

The lie that PPP was sold on was that it was to help small mom & pop businesses survive payrolls through the pandemic.. and it does help small business'... with many receiving small amounts... but we find in the end this is simply cronyism. 

In the last PPP, hundreds of millions of dollars was loaned to giant corporations, many of them publicly traded\[5]. According to the SBA report on the last PPP, **4,840**  loans were greater than **5 million**, **24,838** loans were **2-5 million**, **53,030** loans were **1-2 million**. How are companies that need this much money for payroll small? Why are individual Americans seen as responsible for budgeting for themselves, and therefore responsible for their own failure, but when these huge companies fail to budget, it is not their fault?

You might say well, it is a loan.. Yes this is a loan.. an unsecured one... WITH A 1% INTEREST RATE. Current mortgage rates are more than double this, and they are secured to one of the best assets. Oh and did I forget to mention that the loans can be forgiven\[7]?!

## Other Goods

Most other benefits, seem good, if the funding actually goes to the cause. I would like to highlight the two following.

**$7 billion to broadband** : with Work from Home infrastructure needs to be improved for broadband. If this money is actually used for infrastructure this would be awesome! I am hesitant that this would actually be spent on infrastructure based on telecom companies *great* record of totally not being scum!

**$13 billion for nutrition programs** : Food banks are overwhelmed due to the pandemic\[8] and everyone needs food, so this is great!

# Proud to be Canadian

I would like to talk about why I am proud of the Canadian response.

## CERB

Lost your income during Covid-19? $2000/month\[9]. What about the rules?

* At least 15 years old.
* Eligible for Employment Insurance, or stopped working due to Covid.
* Earned at least $5000 last year.
* Did not quit your job voluntarily.

That's all. This at least covers average rent, EVERYWHERE\[10]. Even Toronto and Vancouver, with some of the most expensive real estate in the world.

## What about Small Business?

We aren't perfect and still have some handouts to our overlords.. but they are in my opinion at least, better. Two main programs I would like to note:

* 75% of an employeeâ€™s wages for qualifying eligible employers
* Small Business Loans are available, up to $60000

\[11] Just looking at these, you can see that these are obviously more reasonable. A dollar value loan to fit the "Small" in "Small Business" and the main program -- the wage subsidy, to directly keep jobs by paying the lions share of the employee's wages.

## Non-Monetary Response

As I am writing this, Quebec, where I currently live has an 8 pm curfew where you can be fined for being out, stores have mandatory capacities, only essential services can remain open. Ontario is currently locked down with only essential business can remain open.

Our government understands that this will hurt people financially, they understand that this will result in some small business' being closed, however we as a country have mostly decided that we are going to take this in turn for saving peoples lives.

We still have quite a lot of people who break the rules and don't listen as I can only guess they have been led astray by conspiracy theories or lack the empathy to understand while they might not directly be hurt by it, our more vulnerable are. The existence of these people explains why we don't have as good of covid 19 stats like New Zealand, or similar countries... however, we still are far ahead of the US, and other countries like the UK.

The Canadian Government has decided to be on the right side of history regarding the pandemic. We are however failing the vaccine rollout as I write this, however this has been mentioned all over the news so hopefully the bad publicity will result in improvement of our process.

# Summary

Allowing lobbying does not work. The politicians just end up putting money into the pockets of the people who stuff the politicians pockets. This makes sense to everyone, but is not stopped as the people in power are the recipients.

While Canada was not perfect in it's stimulus response, and similarly funded the cronies... it was not nearly as big as a kick in the head to the people of the country the politicians are meant to represent. Here's to hoping the vaccine is quick and accepted by all.

I think looking back when we are past this mess, we will see points we can improve on but Canada overall decided the correct path.
