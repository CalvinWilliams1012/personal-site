## The Facts

As of writing this, in my opinion, Canada has failed the vaccine rollout, even if tomorrow every single person was vaccinated, this rollout served as an example of how not to handle similar situations in the future.

As of today, a mere two percent of Canadians have received a COVID-19 vaccine, 2 months into the rollout\[1]. This is despite the fact that Canada has ordered over 400 million doses of various COVID-19 vaccines\[2], enough to vaccinate each Canadian more than 10x....

## Why?

The problem is that today, Canada does not have enough production facilities to produce the vaccine ourselves\[3], so we have ordered them directly from the companies like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, however we have been met with many, many weeks of shipping delays\[4].

Why don't we have enough vaccine production facilities so we can produce it ourselves? Decades and decades ago Canada had many large and great vaccine producers, one example is Connaught Laboratories. Connaught Laboratories was a **non-commercial** medical research laboratory originally established by the **public**, meant to be self funding, but was actually indirectly funded through the university system due to their close ties. It was created for the production of the diphtheria antitoxin in 1914, and was expanded in the 1920's through the universities due to the discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto\[5].

Notice the **bolded words** above, this was created by the Canadian government in order to protect and improve Canadian health, not to turn a profit, and it worked. It was used as mentioned above for the diphtheria antitoxin, which was a leading cause of death for Canadian children\[5], was used to product tetanus antitoxin's during world war I to help protect our troops reducing the rate of wounded soldiers infections to .1%\[6]. 

The facility also distributed Insulin in Canada and around the world, and due to the non-commercial mandate it did this **at cost** to ensure that it was accessible. The standards of this facility would eventually set the international standard for insulin production \[7]\[8]. 

Many other notable actions were performed in this facility throughout the 20th century, development of a blood thinner, prevention of tetanus and typhus during war WWII, blood processing during WWII, production of Penicillin, trials and expansion of the polio vaccine, eradication of smallpox... 

Overall, when one looks at the history of the great things this facility did for Canada, one only has to wonder why it no longer is the giant it once was.

Well, unfortunately, conservatives exist. In 1984, under Brian Mulroney's lead, this facility was privatized, meaning that it was sold by the Canadian government, and purchased by a private company for the purposes of turning profit, rather than improving the health of Canadians. That's about where the history ends, what amazing thing did the facility do next?! Well, it made money for some people, but you will notice from the Wikipedia, [that's kind of where it ends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connaught_Laboratories), no more amazing medical advances or anything of the like...

## Where to Improve

As Canadians, we need to ensure that not only our health care providers are non-commercial, but also our medical research, and production, is not commercial, because as we can see above, this did not; and does not work. The COVID-19 vaccines were majority funded by governments, for example the Pfizer vaccine was funded mostly by the German government\[9].

Healthcare of any sort should not be private. End of story. It does not work, if the only goal is profit, the wellbeing of your people is never going to be the priority.
