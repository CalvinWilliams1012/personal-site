  get beautiful modern furniture for almost no cost.

So I had an issue, I wanted modern looking furniture, but I didn't want to spend the hundreds upon thousands of dollars it would cost to buy it new. So I looked for alternatives. My Nanny offered to give me an old china cabinet she had, and I said sure and I would come up with a plan to make it modern later.

From researching further, and not really wanting to spend time sanding this china cabinet down, I found [chalk paint](https://www.anniesloan.com/products/chalk-paint/). Chalk paint does not need any sanding or priming, and you can simply just apply it directly to the old furniture, then if you need it to be durable, you apply a wax over that. 

That's it. 

I did however run into an issue during this project, as me and my girlfriend accidentally broke one of the panes of glass for the top section.... so we needed to buy new glass. However, as summer was coming, and we were buying some plants, we decided on chicken wire rather than glass, and we can throw some plants in it! 

We staples the chicken wire to the inner side of the doors after painting, voila! Transformed an older, structurally sound piece of furniture that is no longer in fashion, and turned it into a modern piece. Total cost is around $80 dollars because I needed to buy a staple gun, paint brushes, and the paint, wax and chicken wire, however in the future I will just need the paint and wax, reducing the cost further.
