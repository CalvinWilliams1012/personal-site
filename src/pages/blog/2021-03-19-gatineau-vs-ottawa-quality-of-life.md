title: Gatineau vs Ottawa Quality of Life
date: 2021-03-19T04:34:46.438Z
description: I previously wrote a post about Gatineau vs Ottawa cost of living,
  and mentioned that it was only about the cost, this post is about the life
  differences between the two cities. I am hoping to help anyone moving to the
  National Capital Region make their decision.

# They are beside each other..?

Ottawa and Gatineau are only separated by a river, so for example if Ottawa has a restaurant you would like to go to, you can cross the bridge. If you want to go biking in Gatineau Park, just cross the bridge. I am not really going to talk about the social difference, as one can reasonably exist on one side of the river however be associated to the other side socially perfectly fine.

So what am I going to talk about? While Ottawa and Gatineau are only separated by a few hundred meters, they are also separated by a border, and are different provinces with different rules. This is going to be the main focus of this post as if you live in Gatineau, you don't get Ontario's rules, and vice versa.

# Language

This may be pointing out the obvious, but Gatineau, is primarily francophone, while Ottawa is primarily anglophone. For exact numbers, you can see the last [Stats Canada Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=2481017&Geo2=POPC&Code2=0616&SearchText=Ottawa+-+Gatineau&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0) has that 81% of Gatineau's population learned French as their first official language, and 92% of the total population speaking French(a majority of which also speak English). 

Ottawa on the other hand, also according to the last [Stats Canada Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=35505&Geo2=POPC&Code2=0616&SearchText=Ottawa+-+Gatineau&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0) has a huge 97% English majority with around 80% learning English as their first official language.

So the fact is, if you would like to participate in any social activities *in Gatineau*, you may need to learn French. From my experience living in Gatineau, and not knowing French, you are able to get by and unless you travel far from the border, you will find that nearly everyone speaks English if you politely explain you don't speak English. You will however eventually pick up on basic conversation like cashier's asking how your day was or if you would like a bag with your purchase.

# Laws

Ontario and Quebec being difference provinces, have different laws. I will not talk about income tax differences, although they are related to the laws, they are related to cost of living, see [my other post](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2020-09-12-is-it-cheaper-in-ottawa-or-gatineau/) for details on that.

# Bill 101

Related to the Language details above, I would like to point out the fact that [Quebec has Bill 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_French_Language). This Bill defines French as the official language of the provincial government and it's purpose is to make French the language of Quebec in business, communication, law, etc. This obviously makes it different from all other Canadian provinces. If you know or want to learn French, this is fine, however if you wish to only speak English, this may present issues such as forms being only in French.

One example of this I can provide is the provincial health care insurance, Régie de l’assurance maladie, has given me French forms for renewing my Health Card, however, I was able to use the [Google Translate app](https://translate.google.ca/) to translate a picture of the form.

# Bill 21

In my opinion, one of the worst things about Quebec. [Bill 21](https://ccla.org/bill-21/) is a ban on religious symbols. This bans new hires among public workers from wearing religious symbols. As a majority of workers in the NCR are government employees, this may be troublesome if you for example wear a face covering as part of your religion. 

One thing that I find kind of funny is that Quebec essentially banned face coverings before Covid, so during Covid, I guess you could argue that your face covering is for non-Religious purposes ;)

This law is; and will most likely be continuedly fought in court as it is mostly minorities that wear religious symbols as part of their faith, and this is at least to me, blatant discrimination. 

# Covid-19

As I mentioned Covid, [Gatineau ](https://www.gatineau.ca/portail/default.aspx?c=en-CA&p=avis_importants_alertes_urgences/maladie_coronavirus_covid_19)has different Covid rules than [Ottawa](https://ottawa.ca/en/health-and-public-safety/covid-19-ottawa). Some examples, at one point in 2020 their was checkpoints at the bridge's to ensure that your travel was essential, and Gatineau had curfews while Ottawa did not. These rules are ever changing with the situation so see the links above for current differences.

# Misc Other Laws.

These provinces have some other major differences for example with car registration. One major difference in this example is that buying a used car in Ontario, it needs to be safetied, while in Quebec, this isn't required. See Ontario's [registration rules here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/register-vehicle-permit-licence-plate-and-sticker) and [Quebec's here](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/vehicle-registration/).

Quebec's Common/Family law slightly differs from the rest of Canada's, [this article has details](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/fl-lf/divorce/rhro_cl/p3b.html).

Convenience stores and grocery stores in Quebec sell wine and beer, Ontario seems to be taking this on slowly as well, but this is at every store in Gatineau vs only select grocery stores in Ottawa.

Quebec drivers are forced to have winter tires[, unlike Ontario where they are just encouraged to.](https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/winter-tires-a-good-idea-but-wont-become-law-in-ontario-province#:~:text=Ontario%20drivers%20are%20encouraged%20but,snow%20tires%20on%20their%20vehicles.&text=While%20not%20following%20that%20province's,for%20snow%20tire%2Dequipped%20vehicles.)

Quebec [has credit card regulations to curb consumer debt](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebec-introduces-credit-card-regulations-aimed-at-curbing-consumer-debt-1.4533319), including higher monthly payments that are not only interest. Some financial products may also differ in Quebec vs the rest of the Ontario, sometimes favorably due to these restrictions, and sometimes the financial product won't be offered at all in Quebec.

# Healthcare

Quebec, and more specifically Gatineau, is renown for it's subpar Healthcare in comparison to some other provinces such as Ontario or BC. This is an argued point, but the [facts really don't look great for Quebec and Gatineau](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/according-to-new-study-four-of-canada-s-worst-hospitals-are-in-quebec-1.1079004).

Quebec itself however isn't the worst statistically, and actually falls in the [middle ground between all provinces](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/health.aspx), but Gatineau does have [some of the worst hospitals](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-hospital-coroners-report-1.3736927) in terms of emergency care.

If you are living in Quebec, you are able to go to hospitals in Ontario, however you will be billed, and will have to apply for reimbursement from the Quebec health insurance provider, and may or may not be reimbursed the full amount.

# Education

The final difference I wanted to mention is education which is important if you yourself are looking for further education or if you have kids currently in the education system.

As described earlier, Gatineau is primarily French, therefore, a majority of Gatineau's schools are French, while they are English in Ottawa. Gatineau does have some [English schools](https://westernquebec.ca/) however. Due to Bill 101 mentioned above, if your kid is attending a public school(and has not previously attended an English public school somewhere else in Canada) they may be required to be enrolled in a French language school. Quebec does however unlike Ontario [have private school subsidies](https://ecolespriveesquebec.ca/en/private-school/fees/), so it may be more affordable in comparison to Ottawa for your child to attend a private school.

Ontario has public Catholic schools, and non denominational public schools which parents choose between, while Quebec eliminated this and merged 20+ years ago.

Another major difference between the education systems is that unlike all other Provinces where high school goes until grade 12 where they then graduate and can go onto University or College, Quebec students after grade 11 proceed onto pre-university or pre-college classes such as [Cegep](https://www.cegepsquebec.ca/en/).

# Summary

Essentially, from what you can see above, if you are French speaking or willing to learn French, Gatineau does seem like the favorable option. However, if you only speak English and do not want to learn French, you would have a simpler time living in Ottawa.

I will address the elephant in the room now, overall there is some vitriol between both sides of the river and the people that I believe stems from people not having experience with both sides. From what I have found both spending 2 years living in Ottawa, and 3 in Gatineau, people on both sides are mostly kind and compassionate people. If you are kind to others you will mostly find that others will be kind to you, so regardless of where you live just be kind.
