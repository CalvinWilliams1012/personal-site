# Single Income

Once you spend some time learning about FIRE, the concepts for achieving it are fairly simple.. reduce spending, earn more than you spend, invest the rest, start as early as possible. The only issue is that one person can only reduce their spending so far. 

According to [Stat's Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901), the median individual income in 2019 was 37800, I will assume for the sake of argument that anyone more than one paragraph into an article about FIRE earns more than this, we will use the $50000 number as an example as it is slightly above the Stats Canada average. After tax in Ontario, this is ***$39225***.

[According to rentals.ca](https://rentals.ca/national-rent-report), the average rental is $1367/month for a 1 bedroom, and $1694/month for a 2 bedroom. This means that out of our $39225, we then have ***$22821 left over***.

Now the next biggest expense would be a car.. which is true for most Canadians. But no! This person is trying to retire early! Let us say they use public transit, a bike, and when the scenario fits, ride share. If we compare Canadian transit passes we can see it will be around $100/month slightly less or more depending on where this theoretical person lives, or **$1200/year**. Let us also say that they spend **$200/year** on their bike, nothing special, not an enthusiast bike, they maybe a tune-up every year and cost of replacing parts or the bike itself every few years. This person maybe a few times a year will use some ride share apps to go some place that is inconvenient to travel to in other ways, lets estimate it at **$200/year**

Now lets look at food, unfortunately I couldn't really find good data on statistics for a single person Stats Canada has [food spending per household](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110012501), and we can find some articles with [average cost per person](https://globalnews.ca/news/3437328/groceries-budget-canada/), but I couldn't really find data that reveals the truth behind groceries, let us use around ~$250/month, which ends up at **~$3000/year**, and lets say this person eats out or orders food once a week and maybe orders a coffee now and then at around $30/week, I presume many Canadians spend much more, but this is someone attempting to FIRE. This is **$1560/year** which brings our food total to **$4560**.
