# Single Income

Once you spend some time learning about FIRE, the concepts for achieving it are fairly simple.. reduce spending, earn more than you spend, invest the rest, start as early as possible. The only issue is that one person can only reduce their spending so far. 

According to [Stat's Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901), the median individual income in 2019 was 37800, I will assume for the sake of argument that anyone more than one paragraph into an article about FIRE earns more than this, we will use the $50000 number as an example as it is slightly above the Stats Canada average. After tax in Ontario, this is ***$39225***. 

[According to rentals.ca](https://rentals.ca/national-rent-report), the average rental is $1367/month for a 1 bedroom, and $1694/month for a 2 bedroom. This means that out of our $39225, we then have ***$22821 left over***. Most likely they have utilities to pay, but lets say our person got a good deal and this is all inclusive.

Now the next biggest expense would be a car.. which is true for most Canadians. But no! This person is trying to retire early! Let us say they use public transit, a bike, and when the scenario fits, ride share. If we compare Canadian transit passes we can see it will be around $100/month slightly less or more depending on where this theoretical person lives, or **$1200/year**. Let us also say that they spend **$200/year** on their bike, nothing special, not an enthusiast bike, they maybe a tune-up every year and cost of replacing parts or the bike itself every few years. This person maybe a few times a year will use some ride share apps to go some place that are inconvenient to travel to in other ways, lets estimate it at **$200/year.** Our total is **$1600/year** in transportation costs. Leaving us at **$21221**.

Now lets look at food, unfortunately I couldn't really find good data/statistics for a single person Stats Canada has [food spending per household](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110012501), and we can find some articles with [average cost per person](https://globalnews.ca/news/3437328/groceries-budget-canada/), but I couldn't really find data that reveals the truth behind groceries, let us use around ~$250/month, which ends up at **~$3000/year**, and lets say this person eats out or orders food once a week and maybe orders a coffee now and then at around $30/week, I presume many Canadians spend much more, but this is someone attempting to FIRE. This is **$1560/year** which brings our food total to **$4560**. Our left over is at **$16661**.

This person also has other expenses, let us say $50/month for internet, $50/month for their cell phone bill, $30/month for personal care/hygiene, $20/month for cleaning supplies, $25/month for gifts, $25/month for clothing, and lets jam $400/month for hobbies/recreation/other. This is a fairly frugal spending budget for the average Canadian as we can [see here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110022201). Our total is $600/month, or **$7200/year**.

Our grand total remainder comes to **$9461**. We can max our TFSA, and maybe take a nice vacation every year or just stuff it all in RRSP! These numbers aren't the huge tech numbers we see on reddit, but this person would be able to retire after [~20 or less years of working](https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/?age=20&initsav=0&spend=29764&initinc=39225&wr=4&ir=4&retspend=29764&stockpct=99&fixpct=0&cashpct=1&graph=fix&secgraph=0&stockrtn=8.1&bondrtn=2.4&MCstockrtn=0.081&MCbondrtn=0.024&tax=7&income=0&incstart=50&incend=70&expense=0&expstart=50&expend=70) assuming they are at $0. This is around 20 years earlier than the average person.

# Dual Income

Now let us run this through with dual income. Your income is now doubled. **$100000/year**, after tax you have **$78450.** But we also have to remember we now have two people to pay for.

Let us jump to housing! You don't both need an apartment, maybe you want more space so we can go for the 2 bedroom, but housing is not doubled, and that is HUGE! because this expense is HUGE! With the 2 bedroom average from above we spend $1694/month on housing. We have **$58122** left over.

Let us jump to transport, assuming your partner is like minded, and you are both shooting to retire early, let us assume you both use the same transportation as described above, although splitting a single car reduces the cost/person so a car might be more viable. You can't share public transit passes in general, so this cost doubles to **$2400/year**. You also most likely won't share a bike, so this also doubles to **$400/year**. You can however ride share together! So we will slightly increase this as maybe a couple times you might not go together, let us say **$250/year**. Total transportation cost per year is **$3050**. Leaving our total at **$55072**.

Food is up next. Similar to other expenses, food costs do not double from adding another person in most cases. When shopping for groceries, you may get bigger quantities of items which does increase the price, but in general the larger bulk buys are cost efficient. For the sake of this example we will say the food multiplier is somewhere around 1.75. This means that we save 25% on the second persons food costs. Our food total would be **$7980/year**. We have **$47092** remaining.

Now lets go over the other expenses:

* Internet is shared, still $50.
* Both have cell phones, doubles to $100
* Both need personal care/hygiene items, doubles to $60, although it arguably could reduce similar to groceries.
* Cleaning supplies stays the same, you share housing, still $20
* Double the people in general will mean money required for gifting doubles. Doubled to $50
* You don't share clothes! doubles to $50
* The Hobbies/Recreation/other category similar to groceries does not normally double with another person as you generally share some activities which reduces the cost, using the same 1.75 multiplier we get $700

Our total 'other' category is **$1030/month**, or **$12360/year**.

Our grand total **$34732**. However we must not forget this is for two people, let us split it in two, leaving us with **$17366/person** left over!!! This is almost double! This essentially [slashes the time to retire in half](https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/?age=20&initsav=0&spend=43718&initinc=78450&wr=4&ir=4&retspend=29764&stockpct=99&fixpct=0&cashpct=1&graph=fix&secgraph=0&stockrtn=8.1&bondrtn=2.4&MCstockrtn=0.081&MCbondrtn=0.024&tax=7&income=0&incstart=50&incend=70&expense=0&expstart=50&expend=70).

# Summary

The key to understanding why dual income is so powerful is that your income will be doubled, but your expenses will not be. In the above example, the rent is reduced from **$16404/year** per person, to **$10164/year** per person, despite upsizing to a 2 bedroom rather than a 1 bedroom. So even if everything else was doubled, rent alone would save an extra **$6000/year** per person.

The above is just an example, maybe in some categories partnering up actually increases spending, or maybe one partner will make below average income, or some other not mentioned circumstance. Even if we were to account for this, in general, dual income is far better than a single income if we do the math.
