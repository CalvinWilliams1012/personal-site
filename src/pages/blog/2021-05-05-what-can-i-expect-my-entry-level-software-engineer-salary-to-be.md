After recently passing my third year working I was doing some reflection on my past years working in software and with my team bringing in some newcomers I was interested in what an entry level software developer or engineer can expect to make. If someone were to spend all day on [blind ](https://www.teamblind.com/)and only use [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) for estimating the salary they can expect, they might end up rather disappointed.

# Average in Canada

As a Canadian, I started by researching this in Canada. As I mentioned above a junior software developer can expect to make $53950 Canadian dollars. I arrived at this number by taking [indeed](https://ca.indeed.com/career/junior-software-engineer/salaries), [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/junior-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,24.htm), and [payscales ](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Junior_Software_Engineer/Salary)averages, then averaging them! 

I purposefully chose to exclude levels.fyi as the numbers here seem to be oriented to FAANG engineers and in my opinion didn't seem to be representative. Unfortunately, I am unable to get the average junior salary from their website, however I took a sample of 100 of their 'new grad' salaries which resulted in an average of base salary of $100,550. While this is certainly real for some, this is not really representative of the general population, the three other companies I mention above have much better data in my opinion due to being directly linked to the hiring of engineers.

# Average in the Unites States of America

I then was interested in this average in the USA. Taking the same approach of using [indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career/junior-software-engineer/salaries), [glassdoor ](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/us-junior-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,27.htm?countryRedirect=true#:~:text=How%20much%20does%20a%20Junior,is%20%2470%2C442%20in%20United%20States.)and [payscale ](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Junior_Software_Engineer/Salary)I ended with an average of $57267 Unites States Dollars. For more details on salary differences between the two countries, [see my post here](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2020-11-05-do-software-developers-make-more-money-in-the-usa-or-canada/). Unlike the Canadian numbers, these three companies were had over a $10000 dollar difference between their averages, so I am less certain of this number. 

If you were just looking at the [salary comparison on blind](https://www.teamblind.com/salaryComparison) this would be extremely disappointing.

# How Can I Calculate *My* Number?

Averages help get an idea, however they do not give a real representation as your compensation is based on location, skills, and other factors such as highest education level. The best tool I found for estimating your actual salary was the stack overflow salary calculator [available here](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/salary). In this calculator you specify your location, actual desired role, education level, years of experience, and some skills you have. 

This data is from the [](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019)stack overflow developer surveys, and as almost every developer uses stack overflow this is most likely very representative of the real numbers compared to the sectioned off tribes on the internet.

Additionally, when interviewing and receiving offers one could compare with others in your same situation around you such as college friends, and as you have the actual company you can research real salaries from the company on sites like glassdoor or simply by searching '[*company*] [*title*] salary'.

# Other Compensation

This post simply is referring to base salary. When you are entry level, this most likely is the majority of your compensation, however, you must keep other compensation in mind such as stock, 401k/RRSP matching, insurances, paid cell phone/internet and the 'non monetary' compensations such as the estimated work-life balance, vacation time, remote work and maybe if you have some extremely comparable offers, you can even account for other amenities such as meals or gym memberships.

# My Advice

Arm yourself with all the available information and you will start your career off on the best foot. This is extremely important as according to some studies, [your lifetime earnings are probably determined early in your career](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/10/your-lifetime-earnings-are-probably-determined-in-your-twenties/).
