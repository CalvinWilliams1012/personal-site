Similar to my comparison of [Canada vs USA software developer salaries](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2020-11-05-do-software-developers-make-more-money-in-the-usa-or-canada/), this question might not be as easy as you think.. We can look at the average salary in Europe, and compare it to the USA... however, we are not done and have to account for a different currency, different taxes, different benefits from those taxes, and different costs of living. All of this is based on the current numbers I can find at the time of writing this(Maybe I can do a yearly edition).

# Compensation

When we look at the current average software developer salaries in the United States from the following sources: payscale, glassdoor, and indeed as well as the stackoverflow survey. This gives us numbers between $86,222 - $115,000 USD \[1,2,3,4]. Taking the average of the four averages at the time this is being written (June 2021) we arrive at **$102906.75** **USD**.

Then let's go to Europe. Europe consists of many different countries with vastly different cost of living, salary, etc. For example, in London, United Kingdom, according to Glassdoor the average software developer salary is **£53198** \[5] converting this to USD we get **$73474** while in the Kiev, Ukraine, the average salary is **$34200** USD \[6] which is about half.

So to get a good comparison I decided on using the top 5 GDP European countries: Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Russia \[7]. I was able to find that both payscale and glassdoor had averages for all 5 of these countries, taking the average of these averages we get:

* Germany\[8,9] : **€57124.5**
* United Kingdom\[5,10] : **£42126.5**
* France\[11,12] : **€43993.5**
* Italy\[13,14] : **€29016.5**
* Russia\[15,16] : **₽1685032**

I suggest if you are deciding between a job in Europe vs the US, that you perform the calculation for the specific country as these are some very different results even using the top five GDP countries.

# Currency Exchange

The United States using the United States Dollar, while European countries use other currencies such as euros, pound sterling and rubles as you can see above. Conversion to USD and taking the average of these we end up with the final average compensation of **$47130.02** in Europe compared to the **$102906.75** for the Unites States. Italy and Russia seem to have quite significantly lower salaries for developers which I believe slightly skews these results but we will continue on with them.

# Taxes

How much of this are you actually taking home? Taxes are very complicated and difficult to boil down as specific scenarios, states, etc can result in a vastly different tax situations and you get different benefits from these taxes based on what your government pays for and what it doesn't. To calculate the US 'take home' pay I simply used an income tax calculator for the state of California(where many developer jobs are), resulting in **$72973** USD.

Each European country has different taxes and regulations, so I simply used an income tax calculator for each of the 5 examples we are using, resulting in the following 'take home' pays:

* Germany\[18] : **€35074.32**
* United Kingdom\[19] : **£32310**
* France\[20] : **€30508**
* Italy\[21] : **€19835**
* Russia\[22] : **₽1465977**

Converting currencies to USD then averaging these we have an end result of **$33212.92** take home which is less than half of the United States calculated take home.

One thing we also have to account for here is what exactly these taxes are paying for, for example, the Unites States does not have universal healthcare so you must pay health insurance premiums which we can estimate being around an extra **$6015** dollars a year\[24] while this is covered in all of the 5 example countries by some form of universal healthcare. Other differences exist but healthcare seems to be the largest.

# Cost of Living

One of the final aspects is the cost of living, while we currently have a huge difference between the take home pay, if your dollar can buy two times the amount of goods it would make them equivalent. Cost of living is quite difficult to calculate however luckily Numbeo has a huge crowd sources cost of living index\[23].

According to Numbeo, Germany, the UK, France and Italy all rank very similar on the cost of living index, with the outlier being Russia which is quite vastly lower cost of living which somewhat explains its lower salary.

# Summary

Overall, pure take home pay and cost of living, software developers in the Unites States make almost 2x the amount of money with around the same cost of living. However this is not accounting for other benefits such as vacation. In many European countries many weeks of vacation are mandatory while in the Unites States this is not federally mandated, and usually much fewer weeks and even just the general culture of Europe vs USA may be vastly different and you may desire one or the other.

If you are chasing strictly the dollars, the Unites States is where to go.
