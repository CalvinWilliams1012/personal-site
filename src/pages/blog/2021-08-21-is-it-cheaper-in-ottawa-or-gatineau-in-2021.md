This is an updated look at the **cost** of living in Gatineau vs Ottawa, and does not account for differences such as healthcare, services, language, etc.

You can see the [2020 comparison here](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2020-09-12-is-it-cheaper-in-ottawa-or-gatineau/), and you can find the [2020 quality of life differences(non cost related) here](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2021-03-19-gatineau-vs-ottawa-quality-of-life/). 

# Housing

Housing is most likely the largest expense for the average family. This year again we will use the [Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporations "*Rental Market Survey Data Tables*" ](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/rental-market/rental-market-report-data-tables)which gives us average rent in Canadian cities, the data used is for 2020.

![Table displaying Ottawa and Gatineau CMHC rental survey statistics.](/img/ottawagatineaucmhcstats.jpg "Table displaying Ottawa and Gatineau CMHC rental survey statistics.")

From the RMS numbers we see that Gatineau's average rent was **$950**, and the average two bedroom rent in Ottawa was **$1517**. This shows us that the difference between Ottawa and Gatineau is **$567**. Comparing to previous numbers, Gatineau rent has increased by **8.7%**, while Ottawa has increased by **7.6%** with Ottawa being **37.4%** more expensive.

The data tables also show us "Rental Condo Apts" which for Gatineau  we see at **$1206** and Ottawa we see at **$1752,** the difference being **$546.** Comparing this to the numbers from last year, Gatineau saw a **14.4%** increase, while Ottawa saw a mere **1.86%** increase resulting in the difference being narrowed by over **$100**. Overall Ottawa is still **31.2%** more expensive in this category.

Taking the average of these differences, Ottawa is **34.3%** more expensive for rent, or putting it in a dollar term **$556.5** more a month. This makes Gatineau **$6678** cheaper per year.

# Income Taxes

Another major difference between living in Gatineau or Ottawa is the amount of income taxes you pay. Gatineau is in Quebec, with one of the highest income tax rates in Canada, while Ottawa is in Ontario with much lower income tax rates.

Last year we used Simpletaxes calculator, Simpletax was acquired by Wealthsimple, so this year we will use Wealthsimple's [income tax calculator available here](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tool/tax-calculator/). I recommend you enter your real values in the calculator to see the difference, however again for the sake of illustration, I will show the difference at three different income levels, **$50000**, **$100000**, and **$150000**:

At an income of **$50000**, **Ontario income tax is $2177 cheaper**.

At an income of **$100000**, **Ontario income tax is $5607 cheaper**.

At an income of **$150000**, **Ontario income tax is $7456 cheaper**.

Accounting for only the income taxes and rental costs, the income that would make up for the difference in rent is **$130800.** At this income, Ontario is **$6678 cheaper** **per year**,which would be the exact difference we see in rent. Therefore, if you only want to use these two major factors, if you earn less than **$130800**, Gatineau is cheaper, while above this Ontario is cheaper.

# Insurance, Registration, and Licensing

Now we dig into some of the smaller differences or differences that depend on your situation, one of them being the cost of various insurance, licenses and registration. 

To compare auto insurance in last years post, we used the [IBC's "Average Auto Premiums" for 2019 available here](http://www.ibc.ca/bc/resources/media-centre/media-releases/bc-drivers-continue-to-pay-the-highest-auto-insurance-premiums-in-canada). However, unfortunately no updated statistics seem available from them. I was however able to find [updated statistics from Canada Drives available here](https://www.canadadrives.ca/blog/news/car-insurance-across-canada-whats-the-difference#Ontario) which states the average Ontario premium is **$1528**, and the average Quebec premium is **$717**. This is a **$811** difference.

The [license cost renewals have slightly changed in Quebec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/drivers-licence/cost-renewing-licence) it seems with renewal being a base of **$87.28**, with a possible extra fee of **$9.05**, and additional costs depending on your demerit points. Assuming no demerit points, Quebec's cost is **$96.33**. [Ontario's licensing](https://www.ontario.ca/page/driver-and-vehicle-fees) is still **$90**.

Vehicle registration fees have also [increased in Quebec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/cost-registration-renewal/passenger-vehicles) with the total cost including the [contribution to public](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/cost-registration-renewal/passenger-vehicles/contribution-public-transit) transit being **$275.43**. The [total cost in Ontario actually saw a larger increase](https://www.ontario.ca/page/register-vehicle-permit-licence-plate-and-sticker) with this now being **$211** total cost. The breakdown of this is **$32** for vehicle permit, **$59** for the license plate, and **$120** for the plate sticker(Southern Ontario).

The total cost difference between Ottawa and Gatineau's auto insurance, registration and licensing would be **$740.24.** The cost in Gatineau would be **$1088.76**, while the total cost in Ottawa would be **$1829**. Comparing to last years post, the difference has increased by **$42.15** making Gatineau's costs slightly more affordable.

# Child care

Many Canadians have this expense, but not all. This year we again will look at [the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives study on the subject](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/newsroom/news-releases/high-child-care-fees-persist-canada-right-government-action-can-lower-parent). This has the average cost of childcare for Infants, Toddlers and Preschool, see below:

![Ottawa and Gatineau childcare difference](/img/childcaredifference.jpg "Ottawa and Gatineau childcare difference.")

Not much has changed here, however due to Quebec having subsidized childcare, Gatineau is much more affordable. Gatineau is **$841/month** cheaper for Infants, **$861/month** cheaper for Toddlers, and **$831/month** cheaper for Preschoolers. 

This results in Gatineau being **$9972 to $10332 cheaper** annually for childcare.

# Overall

This year we see about the same as last year. In order for Ottawa to be the best financial option, you need to have around double the median income for Canadian families, and you would need an even higher income if you had to also account for the huge difference in childcare costs.

We see a fairly large difference in rents this year as Gatineau prices seemed to have increased more than Ottawa's, the cost difference will continue to shrink resulting in Ottawa possibly being the more affordable option, especially if a childcare subsidy is introduced. 

As I noted last year, other small costs can be calculated such as the sales tax difference of over 1%, which could impact you if you are planning a large purchase such as a vehicle, or EV rebates in Quebec, or First Time Home buyers incentives in Ontario. 

I recommend you use the resources above to find out if Ottawa or Gatineau is the more affordable option. Overall to the average Canadian, Gatineau is more affordable.
