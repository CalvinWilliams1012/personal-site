This is an updated look at the **cost** of living in Gatineau vs Ottawa, and does not account for differences such as healthcare, services, language, etc.

You can see the [2020 comparison here](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2020-09-12-is-it-cheaper-in-ottawa-or-gatineau/), and you can find the [2020 quality of life differences(non cost related) here](https://calvinwilliams.ca/blog/2021-03-19-gatineau-vs-ottawa-quality-of-life/). 

# Housing

Housing is most likely the largest expense for the average family. This year again we will use the [Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporations "*Rental Market Survey Data Tables*" ](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/rental-market/rental-market-report-data-tables)which gives us average rent in Canadian cities, the data used is for 2020.

![Table displaying Ottawa and Gatineau CMHC rental survey statistics.](/img/ottawagatineaucmhcstats.jpg "Table displaying Ottawa and Gatineau CMHC rental survey statistics.")

From the RMS numbers we see that Gatineau's average rent was **$950**, and the average two bedroom rent in Ottawa was **$1,517**. This shows us that the difference between Ottawa and Gatineau is **$567**. Comparing to previous numbers, Gatineau rent has increased by **8.7%**, while Ottawa has increased by **7.6%** with Ottawa being **37.4%** more expensive.

The data tables also show us "Rental Condo Apts" which for Gatineau  we see at **$1,206** and Ottawa we see at **$1,752,** the difference being **$546.** Comparing this to the numbers from last year, Gatineau saw a **14.4%** increase, while Ottawa saw a mere **1.86%** increase resulting in the difference being narrowed by over **$100**. Overall Ottawa is still **31.2%** more expensive.

Taking the average of these differences, Ottawa is **34.3%** more expensive for rent, or putting it in a dollar term **$556.5** more a month. This makes Gatineau **$6678** cheaper per year.

# Income Taxes

Another major difference between living in Gatineau or Ottawa is the amount of income taxes you pay. Gatineau is in Quebec, with one of the highest income tax rates in Canada, while Ottawa is in Ontario with much lower income tax rates.

Last year we used Simpletaxes calculator, Simple tax was acquired by Wealthsimple, so this year we will use Wealthsimple's [income tax calculator available here](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tool/tax-calculator/).
